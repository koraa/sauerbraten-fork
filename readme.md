### Download Packages Branch
On the server you can place some addon-packages like "duel maps", "forge" .. which will be available to download.
Connected to this Server you can list all available packages by typing /listpacks and afterwards download the pack you want with "/getpack <num>"
The Server will then send you a list of files included in this pack (e.g. "turbine.cfg" "turbine.ogz" "textures/trek5/basic.jpg" ..) and the client afterwards requests whats needed.
